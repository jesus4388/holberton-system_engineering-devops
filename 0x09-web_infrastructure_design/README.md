# 0x09. Web infrastructure design

## Synopsis

#### At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
-  You must be able to explain what each component is doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
- As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
- For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
- After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
- Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
- Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
- In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
